WidgetFX SDK 1.2
The JavaFX Desktop Widget Platform

WidgetFX is a desktop widget platform written in the new JavaFX Script language. It can run widgets written in JavaFX Script and Java and takes advantage of the latest features in the Java Consumer JRE (Java SE 6 update 14).

This release is targeted at developers who are interested in authoring new widgets.  To learn how to create your own widget:
* Give the Hello World tutorial a try.  It introduces the basics of widget development in JavaFX Script.
* Read up on JavaFX Script.  There are lots of interesting things you can do with this technology, and when combined with Java libraries anything is possible.
* Join the user mailing list.  The WidgetFX team is glad to answer questions or hear comments and feedback directly from users: http://groups.google.com/group/widgetfx-users

Enjoy the first public release of the WidgetFX framework with many more to come!
