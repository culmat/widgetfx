*Q: My JAR file XYZ.jar is not found by WidgetFX even though I can enter it's url and download the file.*
  * A: Do you have a version enabled jar file with for example [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/downloadservletguide.html Java Web Start JnlpDownloadServlet]? I.e accessing the jar with ".../XYZ.jar?version-id=1.0". WidgetFX's method of getting your jar file is not version aware yet, therefore you need to supply a default jar that can be downloaded with no version information specified.

*Q: I get an MalformedURLException when WidgetFX tries to open my jnlp file.*
  * A: There's a bug in the javafxpackager which produces a malformed "update" tag in the jnlp file. When the file is downloaded by WidgetFX this tag is replaced with a correctly terminated tag. If the file has been edited in a way that the string can't be found a MalformedURLException is thrown. Fix or remove the update tag to solve this.
